          [Music] oh [Music] welcome back folks this is ICT with a fifth installment of the eight in the continuing series for the first month of the ICT mentorship for the month of September the previous tutorial in session four we looked at equilibrium versus discount this session we're going to be looking at equilibrium versus premium we went through a great deal of content in regards to Discount versus equilibrium so we won't have to spend so much time with this tutorial because everything we're shell here is basically
          
          diametrically opposed to what you would expect to see in the equilibrium versus discount to teaching so looking at what we have uh when we look for premium markets markets that are in a premium now when we talk about uh Commodities later on in this mentorship uh the the topic of Premium will come up again uh but when I'm referring to premium is it relates to to price action uh I'm actually referring to the current range that we're uh trading in and the first thing we look for is an Impulse price swing which is we have an Impulse
          
          price swing here we have another impulse price swing here we have another impulse price swing here so the first thing we look for in price is an Impulse swing and we see one here we see another one here we see another one here and these three price swings actually make up one larger price swing which is an Impulse leg or impulse swing by its o by its own right so when we Define our ranges okay the use of the Fibonacci is helpful in this case because we can take the FIB draw from a high down to a
          
          price low and I'm using this low here because it's the most lowest in contrast to this high and price comes all the way back up to what I have taught in many years the optimal trade entry which is a standard 79% to 62% retracement level on the FIB now I didn't create that but if it was as simply looking at that alone 62% to 79% Trac levels uh looking for buys and sells there everywhere be loaded it would be no no work at all in terms of uh taking trades but obviously you probably learned very quick there's much
          
          more to it than just pulling a fib over top of price swings uh we have in this larger price swing we have a smaller price swing here okay and we have the high down to this low and the market starts to retrace equilibrium or half of the impulse price swing has to be at least touched and then once it hits that we watch for price to reach up into this area here now there's other disciplines out there and other mentors other teachers will say that the 50% retracement level is a good level to trade at based on price swings I don't
          
          agree with that um I understand that sometimes it's going to work but what I want to do is I want to be selling at a market that's in a premium level um for a market to be in a premium in this current price range here and it's assuming none of the price action from this high down all the way to the right has not happened yet so you'd be watching price in this initial range and price did not get back up to the Midway point or 50% of the uh uh the range that was created from the high to low that's
          
          all equilibrium is it's 50% on the fit how I'm describing it but the concept is is you have to see a a market price a move above the halfway point once it does that start it starts going into what is referred to as a premium Market that means it's at a really high price relative to its current trading range we don't need overball and oversold indicators to help us uh classify an overbought oversold Market we just simply need to know the current price range we're trading in and if we get above the 50% level okay we start
          
          getting into what would be deemed as overbought or at a premium level on this price swing here it obviously never gets above the 50% never even touches it so it never gives us an opportunity to get short relative to this time frame or this price swing so there would be nothing to do there the next price leg here okay the same thing from this high to this low nothing in terms of that price swing there it doesn't get back up to the 50% uh level but look closer there's another smaller price swing that
          
          has formed right in here okay so we could look at that measure the high to the low and the market gets right to a pre uh I'm sorry equilibrium but does not stay above to go to a premium Market it only goes right to the Fibonacci 50 level or what we deem as equilibrium so price goes to an equilibrium price point and then immediately sells off this would be a missed opportunity in regards of looking at equilibrium to premium the reason why we want to focus primarily on the 62 or 79% retracement levels in that range to
          
          be selling short is because the Market's going to be really pressed higher and would be really in terms of overbought and oversold it would be very overbought and it would be expecting a willingness to to sell softer and go lower um there's going to be times when the market does not give that scenario to you and you just got to let those uh particular price swings go without you the next price [Music] swing is this High to this low Market trades back up to equilibrium here and move this over so you can see a little
          
          bit better okaye Market trades back to equilibrium goes back above it into a premium market and it goes right on through what would be deemed as an optimal trade entry okay or selling at a premium so here's a wonderful thing about this you can look at this and say okay if I'm measuring this High to this low and I want to be selling I'm above equilibrium I want to get short in this area between 62 and 79% tracing level okay uh you look over here maybe there's something over here institutionally um
          
          in terms of a bearish order block or something like that you can Define we're going to say that that's not there we're going to say that you went short just purely on price action retracing back into the Fibonacci level here it comes all the way up and hits you where your stop would be when you see these conditions where the market trades above equilibrium and goes through the levels of 62 and 79% TR levels what that does is it gives you a condition that we saw in the equilibrium to discount if it takes out a previous
          
          low when it's in discount it's probably going to be a turtle soup byy in this case it's going to be a turtle soup Cell It's going to be reaching for stops above the impulse swings high and you see that here it goes up runs out the stops here and then it goes lower where is it going to go where do you take profits at below lows that's already established in the marketplace here and here you see that's exactly what the market does you can also use when you're defining your ranges all price swings from high down to low okay
          
          you you you want to Anchor your your Fibonacci one the market goes down from this high all the way down to here okay and creates that low as soon as we start seeing it bounce up you need four candles remember it's the same thing we just saw on the equilibrium to Discount teaching once you see a a swing low form you're watching that fourth candle to show willingness to go higher it does but then you simply wait here's the equilibrium price point this this 50% level in the f price goes through that
          
          so now you're going to be watching it you want to watch and see if price gets to 62 to 79% Trac levels it does and it does it while it's running out that high here so two scenarios one you could have used this High down to this low and got a stop out in the initial uh 62 to 79 trement levels where we saw earlier but it ran right through it if you had not anchored your FIB to this High to this low you would never see this optimal trade entry okay or return to a premium to go short price is above the equilibrium price point and it
          
          takes out an old High so we're running stops at an old high and we're going back into what would be a premium Market we're above the equilibrium price point of the Range High and the range low and we take stops out that's really really good in terms of probabilities and the market goes down and sweeps out a previous low remember when we were looking at the equilibrium to Discount every time we were buying we were taking profits at above an old high okay so when you see that all we're seeing is the reverse of
          
          that in the equ ium versus premium market so we're always looking to sell at a premium premium is defined by it has to be above the equilibrium price point or 5 50% level the Fibonacci anchored on a uh swing of clear discernable price action in other words if it looks sloppy if you if it doesn't really look a solid price swing and obviously obvious price swings are the ones we look at we're not looking at anything that looks questionable if it's a pure price swing we measure it and this is a high this is a low and we went
          
          through all potential stages of all these high to low high to low high to low scenarios really nice scenario here again taking profits initially below this low here when it would hit that and then you'd hold out for potential run for some of your trade to be taken off below this low here now Market goes into another uh area of Premium relative to equilibrium and go back to this larger price swing here this low all way up to this High Market goes right into the 79 79% retracement level hits it perfectly to
          
          the pit then rolls down where do you take your profits at you're going to be looking to take profits at below this low here okay and into the order block down in here which is what you see right there okay you have another range that you can use this high to this low Okay now what's what's really nice about this is if the Market's in a consolidation this type of trading is your go-to okay A a long protraction state in the marketplace where it goes up and down no no real movement higher in One Direction or lower in One
          
          Direction it just stays in a large consolidation you want to be trading Turtle soups or understanding where premium and discount are are and if you have the high here and you pull down to the low here when the market gets above equilibrium right in here it goes right into the 70.5 or what would be the optimal trade entry sweet spot okay or OT and the market is a sell off there where where do you to look to take your profits at below and old low or below this low right there every time the market makes a swing low you
          
          have to take a look and it only takes three candles this is why I do not use the the Williams uh fractal that requires five candles I only need three candles so we have a candle low here a lower candle low here a small smaller little candle in here the market blows through that that would be your uh your target right there you would take first profit then you would come back and end up taking your stop out right there now if you get a stop and say you don't take first profit let L devil's advocate for a moment say
          
          you're greedy you're patient you're developing you just don't want to do anything to take some profits out or it couldn't happen for you you didn't do it like that the market comes back and takes your stop loss out if you see that scenario okay you're going to be looking for old highs to be breached while we're above the 50% uh level so we're in Pre we're in a deep premium okay so markets are overbought right in here the market runs through this previous high so we're in turtle soup scenario we could be
          
          looking for turtle soup cells or comes up starts to come down one more time runs through you takes your stop out again this is going to happen in your trading do not try to avoid it because it's going to happen same scenario we have an old high Market goes back above it if it's at a premium and you've defined the range here you take this scenario as a sell on Turtle suit basis breach above a old high sell short break want to take profits out below the first low that's here the next low is right here and we have another range
          
          created here so while we're watching this form soon as we see a swing low form this candle here we know they're probably going to want to run back up into this range here now we have a new Range the impulse price swing is this High down to this low here's equilibrium price expands to equilibrium one we start seeing that we watch does it get to 62 it does the bodies of the candle stop perfectly right there you could sell short right there what's nice is is you're going to see the bottom of this candle this up
          
          candle that's a bearish over block which you'll learn more about that's a sell by itself where you look to take profits at below the old low right in here goes right down below that and does what trades back up higher if we use the price swing from the high we just anchor to to this low the same thing occurs here we have this High all the way down to this price low price comes all the up into the 79 Trace level above equilibrium we start watching it now we're in an area where the price is going into
          
          equilibrium I'm sorry from equilibrium up into premium okay premium is above equilibrium in a Range that's been defined from high to low and look what's happening we're running out of an area of stops above an old high again very very good uh probabilities for getting short take that as a turtle soup inside of a premium based market and you can look to take profits on a swing low here's your swing low here the market trades down through that you'd have to take profits below here Market trades down into small little
          
          consolidation here and I'm not going to Define anything else that's in this chart cuz I can do all kinds of other things to it would look like sh coding but you'll learn other things to look at and it has to do with this candle over here so we'll refer to this candle later on and uh recapitalize bullish order blocks and bearish Order blocks but the market creates another range this High down to this low here so this High down to this low Market goes above equilibrium here where's it going to go to we want wat to
          
          go to at least 62% retracement level it does that goes right up to the 70.5 OT optimal trade entry and then sells off where take profits at below swing low right here's a swing low take profits right there now they're not astronomical trades okay they're not enormous trades but to get short in here at 98 big figure and covering below the low on this candle here at 9694 that's over 100 Pips nothing wrong with that this is a daily chart we're trading off of again this is helping these folks that cannot
          
          be doing day trades okay you don't need a great deal of movement on a daily chart to make a decent amount of Pips we're going to go back to this high and use that same old low here okay from this high down to this low if you went short here based on a stop run above here and we're in a premium we're above the equilibrium we've defined our range we're looking to sell into strength it's scary when you first start looking at it as a new Trader but that's exactly what you want to be doing as a professional Trader you want to be
          
          selling at premium prices think about it if you could sell something if you own it say you own a car and you want to sell your car do you want to sell it at a discount that doesn't make any sense you want to sell it at a premium so professional Traders sell their long positions or they sell new short positions at premium prices there ain't no better place in the world to sell short or sell Longs above a old high because there's going to be willing buyers right there in the form of buy stops so when we see this
          
          area here we get short from this area here going short and if you just took took profits once this low formed that low comes in at 9739 9739 and the open is 9799 so we're going to say we went short somewhere around the 98 big figure the low comes in at 9739 so that means your stop I'm sorry your limit order to take profits would be below 9739 so you'd get below here say you're aiming for 10 Pips below that low below this low right here you'd be looking for 9729 roughly uh 9730 that's 70 Pips using a setup that's
          
          on the daily chart you're not intraday trading you're not looking at 5 Minute 15 minute charts you know you're not you're not being forced to do what ICT does most of his teachings through in day uh trading but the same Concepts appear in these higher time frame charts so don't discount it that I'm teaching you in a 15minute basis because all the concepts are Universal and I know it's hard for you to understand that as a new Trader because it just seems like I can't be watching that chart so therefore I can't trade that's not true
          
          that's not true at all so by having these ideas of looking at price over the course of a premium Market if we go down to a say we go down to an hourly chart okay and what's nice is you don't have to trade with a bias most people are always asking me hey look can can you give me a a way of trading with a a daily bias give me the trend Direction Michael I need to know that well you don't really need to know that you don't need to know it and the reason why you don't need to know it is because you
          
          need to know how to trade inside of a range because those ranges are always there whether you're in a trending Market whether you're in a consolidation or they're in reveral Market those profiles will always give you ranges to trade in and you don't need to to break out of the range to make money we have a swing High here why am I using that swing High Michael not this one here not this one here because this is the most recent one prior to this down move I could use this one here but I'm going to use this one
          
          because it has more price action around it this High down to the lowest low okay Market trades up to the equilibrium in here okay does it get to premium no it doesn't get up there yet it comes down off of this a little bit and then trades right up into 79 C Trac level right in here closes in a Range which we'll talk about in the next teaching over here market sell it sells off and where you going to be looking to take profits at you have a small little swing low here you have a certain real good swing low here so if you're getting
          
          short up here and on an hourly basis say we got short at 9770 nice round number to get out that level here is 42 Pips To Get Out Below this low here 60 Pips so if you go go 10 Pips below that that'll give you nice 70 Pips it give you nice 70 Pips and there look at the reaction going 10 Pips below here you have this range low from that high up here where we would have been selling at based on the concepts again it's all hypothetical and hindsight here but the conceptual idea is the same going forward range is
          
          60 Pips 10 Pips below will be 70 you got at least four Pips below that for uh for spread to take you out and absolutely does that and it doesn't go very much low at all
