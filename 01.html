          [Music] [Music] hello folks this is ICT and welcome to the mentorship this is the first first installment to all of the teaching tutorials you're going to have for this month generally you're going to have eight teaching tutorials that'll be delivered every week two at a time uh on Saturday so every Saturday will be delivery day for each week's teaching tutorial every week being two teaching modules um September is the launch month for this mentorship program and this is the only one you're going to have that
          
          has nine videos so this is actually aimed at getting the Newbie up to speed real quick so that way they can watch the market and monitor the things that we're doing uh via the Twitter feed and the form um while it's not going to try to teach everything in the tutorial section it will get them up the speed quickly and allow them to see the same thing in terms of time and price which is important because if we're not looking at the same thing uh it can be rather confusing so we're going to look at what
          
          demo account everyone should be utilizing um if you're using a different demo account than what I'm setting up here and teaching through as the medium in our mentorship group uh over the next 12 months we will be utilizing demo account only it's for my protection because I'm not uh licensed to give Trad device and this is not trade device this is actually uh studying price action in a group setting uh using Concepts that I've employed over the last two decades so if you are using a different demo
          
          account uh you need to stop using that one and use what we're going to be setting up today it'll give you all the functions and resources that you see used in my videos and in my teaching tutorials uh more specifically it'll give you uh the same reference in terms of price action so when I'm referring to something in a a chart um it'll avoid all of the confusion well my chart looks like this or I'm having a problem with this candle and that candle's not lining up um I'm going to remove all of those
          
          barriers and speed bumps to everyone's development and a distraction from the overall group um you're learning how to trade price so we're all going to have to use the same medium while we're learning okay so the entire 12 months going forward uh because this is a teaching capacity aimed at delivering the content through a demo account only not live account not live um myx books and all that stuff it's aimed at delivering understanding of price action and if we don't have the same reference point okay it's going to be confusing
          
          and it's going to create a multitude of questions that'll never end because everyone's data provider is going to be slightly different than what I'm uh providing so again what you'll do is this is how you set up your demo account this is how you find what I use going go into Google and you're going to type in Forex LTD and you're going to hit enter okay and it's going to take you to this site right here Forex LTD internet trading in the the world currency Market this Forex ltd. co.uk okay I do not trade with this firm
          
          I do not have an account with this firm I'm not inviting you to be a customer of them I just think that they have the absolute best demo account to work within and that's the one I've been using for years okay for the last six and a half years I've been teaching through the capacity of this specific one and I'll give you all the reasons why as we go through this video click on the link okay and it's going to give you the welcome page here okay and what you're going to be doing is you're going to be looking for a demo account
          
          you're going to click on that and it's going to give you a link here download metatrader 4 not metatrader 5 not metatrader 27 okay metatrader 4 okay when you click on that it'll give you your download window in here okay and then what you do is you you click on this and you you click open I'm not going to do that because I actually have it already installed in my computer but we're going to go over to the desktop once you run it it'll install automatically and once you install it you're going to launch the
          
          program okay and what you're going to do is you're going to want to set up a set up a demo account inside the platform because so far you just have the software program you're going to go up to file okay you're going to go to open and account you need to look for Forex Das server Forex LTD okay that's what you want to look for scroll through all this business if you can't find it if you don't see that you need to click on here add new broker okay and when you click on that adding new broker you're going to type in these
          
          things here Forex hyphen server Forex LTD okay and then you're going to do a next you want to click on new demo account and you're G to put in your name or demo baller Incorporated put your email address in here I don't really give them an email address and I never give them my real name and I generally rotate out of this demo account every two two three weeks I rotate out so if you ever watched my videos you always see there's a different uh account number up here um I just don't want to have anybody tracking me based on that
          
          so and they probably could still do that nonetheless but either way that's why I do it um you're going to be clicking uh nothing on here it's going to come up as a default Forex $5,000 you're going to set it to 50 to one okay and any phone number in there I usually use the local Pizza Hut or Domino's just an inside gag but it can be whatever you want it to be okay and then you got to click on I agree to so subscribe to newsletters I don't mind at all cuz it's never going to go to my email address not one that I
          
          have actually and you're going to wait for it to process now here's what you can use for my effects book now um you want to keep this information because as we get a little bit further into the mentorship I will be asking you all to set up my f book okay um I don't want to hear any crybaby and I don't want to do it I see trust me it's going to be very educational and it's not to compare who's better than what it's I'm going to show you statistics and analytics using myx book to help us frame high
          
          probability setups okay so and also I'm going to be looking at your overall uh development at the end of your 12 months so I'm going to be hopefully seeing uh the fruits of my labor here but you need all this information here so write all these things down your login number your password number and your investor um number here okay you need all those things and when it comes time for us to go into the myx book and to set up a myx book for um analytics and teaching high probability setups uh we'll need all
          
          this information to sync up okay so but we'll talk about that later on down it's a couple months away so we're going to click on finish and you want to open up a chart okay and we're going to say uh US dollar Index now the reason why I like this Forex LTD demo account is it comes stocked with the US dollar Index now I have done this download so many times just to see if it comes up a different way where the US dollar Index is not available to you as as an immediate resource um if by chance you do what I'm
          
          doing here in this tutorial and you don't see the dollar Index USDX okay what that stands for if it doesn't appear in your platform it's very easy to find okay you're just going to go up to this little icon here it has a little down arrow and an up Arrow when you when you move your cursor over top of it it's going to say market watch you tap on that anywhere on here anywhere on this list of symbols you're going to take your mouse and right button click okay and you're going to click on show all when you do that and you close
          
          out the market watch uh table here when you go back up to click on file and click on new chart the US dollar Index will appear I've never seen it not be there when I first downloaded and I've never heard anyone tell me that it's not like we're seeing here but in the event that it doesn't trust me for xltd offers US dollar Index that's the dollar Index I use for all my analysis so you want to click on that and go to a daily chart okay okay and you'll get the same exact daily chart that ICT uses in all
          
          of my videos so once we have this okay we can go into a few things um I'm actually making available a ICT Kill Zone indicator with this video so that way you're going to be able to reference specific times of the day because this video module is introducing you the concept of number one setting ups that way we're all looking at the same thing at the same time of day and relative to New York time which we're going to calibrate in a few moments but I want you to understand that you're going to get indicators that go along with the
          
          teachings so every month you'll get something new that helps you streamline your analysis and and cut time initially I'm going to make you work a little bit because it's important you understand what you're looking at do not grow accustomed to just using indicators now indicators are not um calculating anything okay all my indicators do is hi highlight time and price so it's not giving you any buy or sell it's just referencing time and price okay and we'll talk more about that uh topic throughout the next 12 months but for
          
          now I want you to calibrate to New York time now if you download this platform for U demo account trading uh it's going to be the same exact platform time as mine now where you are at around the globe I I have no idea okay I don't know exactly where you're actually located at and your time zone is going to be different to what this platform is it does not matter what you're concerned about is is you want to calibrate your local time with the platform time and relative to New York time so what you
          
          need to do is know always what time it is in New York so if we see uh that we're looking at this right now we go to an hourly chart tap the endend D button it'll take you to the farthest right portion of the chart okay and if we look at this candle right here and just put the mouse cursor over top of it it's saying that's the 2200 hour candle okay 2200 hour candle relative to New York time that's six PM right now so 2200 on mt4 platform through Forex LTD 2200 is 6 o' let me zoom in a little bit
          
          more so this candle on an hourly basis is 6: p.m my time okay for the platform it's 2200 hours 2100 hours is five o'clock my time in in New York Time 4 o'clock New York 3 2 1 noon 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 midnight okay midnight and it's the 4 GMT time on this platform so when it's The 4400 on the mt4 platform downloaded through Forex LTD this candle is always until it's changing for daylight savings time to um back to Standard Time um this candle will move to 5 GMT but right now it's four it's 4 okay so what you're
          
          going to do is is you're going to look at that candle and put a vertical line right on it so that's midnight in New York now I don't know where you are in time relative to New York time you need to determine what that time is where you're at so that way you're always on New York time and an easy way to do that is to go over to Google okay you're going to go into Google and type in current time in New York okay right now it's saying 6:29 p.m. as you can see down here 6:29 p.m. so you need to figure out what your time
          
          is locally wherever you're at in the world and contrast that with what New York time is okay because it's important we always know what time midnight 12 a.m. in New York is because that's the new trading day despite whatever you might have heard about Wellington being the new day it's not okay it's always going to be relative to 12:00 a.m. in New York that's where the bank banking alos operate on when go into setting up true day format which is what we're going to talk about in a minute let's go back to the
          
          Chart okay and now we understand that 40400 on Forex LTD right now under daylight savings time that's midnight in New York okay so that's midnight New York now if we want to know what the kill zones are okay 2 o00 in the morning okay so if this is an alley candle at midnight there's 1:00 in the morning New York 2:00 in the morning New York and if you hold down if you highlight an object on N4 hold down control double tap and drag away you'll duplicate it so you have midnight here 1:00 in the morning New York 2:00 in the
          
          morning New York 3:00 in the morning New York 4:00 in the morning New York 5 5:00 in the morning New York that's 5:00 in the morning is 0900 in Forex LTD so what we just did is we delineated New York midnight candle and we also referenced what time is the ICT London open Kill Zone now it technically can start as early as 1:00 in the morning here okay but for now I just want you to focus on 2:00 in the morning right now because that's going to be the best signals and that's the reason why we're doing a mentorship because I want you to
          
          focus primarily on the strongest setups so if it's happening before 2:00 in the morning you're going to let it go so 2:00 in the morning 3:00 in the morning 4:00 in the morning up to 5:00 so 5 o'clock closes the the window of the ICT Kill Zone now once we have that frame of reference okay we can change rather we want to make this a solid line and it could be whatever colors you want to set it up to delineate what it is referring to but this is going to refer to as midnight in New York okay so going forward in mentorship I'm going to
          
          stick with the color scheme we're having here this blue line is delineating 0400 in forx ltd's demo account and that means we're showing and highlighting New York at midnight 12:00 a.m. okay that's the new day this is the ICT Kill Zone okay so it's midnight 1:00 2:00 in the morning 3:00 in the morning 4:00 in the morning 5:00 in the morning so between these two vertical lines in here that delineates the ICT Kill Zone so if we drop down to a 15-minute time frame this entire area down here okay is the London Kill Zone
          
          so you just highlight that with a little a uh I'm sorry rectangle okay and there you go you have it so you don't have to take these and keep them on your chart to CL it out you just remove that now once you have this this is going to give you a frame of reference for trading the New York I'm sorry the London session now you you have to identify what the New York session is go back out to the hourly chart okay so we have midnight uh 1:00 in the morning 2 3 4 5 6 7 7:00 on an alley chart is 1,00 on Forex
          
          ltd's metatrader 4 while daylight savings time is underway so 1100 Begins the New York session Kill Zone so that's 7:00 in the morning New York time so you want to be looking at 7:00 8:00 9:00 10:00 there's your kill zone for New York session so we're going to go back down to a 15-minute time frame duplicate that and if you watch down here it'll give you the time and I'm going now that it's highlight I'm going to drag this Edge to this box until it goes to 1100 right there see it right here 1100
          
          right down here when I touch it and then I'm going to drag it so there's 8:00 at 1200 9:00 is 1300 10:00 is400 okay and I'm just going to drop it right there okay so there you have your two kill zones you have see have both kill zones London Kill Zone and the New York Kill Zone okay and you're going to do this for each chart every single day for the first month I will give you a Killzone indicator in October so that way you just click it and it'll pop it up on your charts but for homework and for practicing and
          
          logging your charts and observing price action for each currency pair that you're trading or following and you really should be only watching one right now so pick one we're going to focus primarily on the cable and sometimes we'll talk about the the euro dollar so uh depending upon those two you're going to do your own homework on one of those pairs and stick to primarily only doing that for the first month once you have this framed like this okay we can go back out to an alley chart okay don't worry about this being
          
          off cuz when we go back down into a 15-minute time frame it'll get neat and Orly all over again so we have midnight here so this starts the day so we have 1:00 in the morning 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1 2 3 why 3 3:00 on M and Forex LTD is 1,900 that's when the bond market closes in the US Market the 30-year treasury market closes at 3:00 and it encapsulates the day when there's fomc announcements at 2 p.m. in New York so because that can occur at 2 p.m. we have to incorporate the entire 2:00 to
          
          3:00 time window so we have to look at that that candle here as ending the day at 1900 so we will take another vertical line and we'll drop it right on 19 00 again the time is relative to the Forex LTD platform okay and then we'll change this to a red solid red okay so that way we know that we have now created true day enter Bank format for determining what the TR daily range is okay so the true daily range is at midnight it trades down makes the low in London open during the London open Kill Zone then it
          
          makes a low and it rallies up okay then it gives you a buy signal in continuation with the low that was formed in London and it runs higher okay and it trades into the profit taking hour which is between 10:00 and and 11:00 generally but it can go as late as noon and we'll talk about that later on in this mentorship but for now I want you to focus primarily on these two specific Windows a time in the day it will make a high between 10:00 and noon every single day that it's going to be a bullish day um if it doesn't reverse in
          
          New York all between these these time windows in other words when this begins here and ends here between those time windows or in other words this is why I like doing this because you can do this you drag it straight up and you can highlight the exact Kill Zone time when the signal or um uh setup forms okay and once you understand what you're looking for what is it specifically are you looking for well we're looking at a 15minute time frame so if we're looking at 15minute time frames like this is there any one time
          
          frame that's better than another no the reason why is because you have to understand what you're going to be studying is price itself not you're not just studying a 15-minute time frame you're not just studying an hourly chart you're not just studying a daily chart or a weekly chart you're studying price and you'll be following institutional order flow and it's going to leave fingerprints that may not be very clear on one time frame but be very crystal clear on another so if you have these understandings and understanding of
          
          institutional overflow which you'll learn more about as you go through this entire mentor ship uh we have three candles here that are down right before the up move so the order block begins on this candle right here the Down Candles is where uh the alos are accumulating buy orders and they're running a short-term low here during London you get a stop run traditionally in London session the market creates a rally these three Down Candles is where you're going to see the beginning of the order block
          
          so you can use the body of the can up to the high so you can see the order block begins here at the the open or where the body of the candle starts and all this range here is the actual order block but the open on this candle comes in at 9564 that level is important because if we do get a low form in London and it rise up through a short-term high like this that will give us framework to look for a New York session Buy it'll come back down into a bullish order block which it trades again let's look at the the B's open on here it's
          
          9564 during the New York session Kill Zone okay the low comes in at 9564 and this candle as well is 94 I'm sorry 9564 so when it trades down there that's time and price meeting inside a Kill Zone that's a New York session buy or reversing that it gives us a sell scenario for foreign currencies if there's technicals that that line up in symmetrical terms but because this is a bank holiday in the Canadian market and the US market we were just observing today okay but even in these conditions you can still see that the market still
          
          creates the same patterns all the time because the algo doesn't go off duty because it's a holiday it's still going to generate volatility it's just going to be very small volatility okay so now we can go and Shrink this back down I've already outlined what the Kill Zone does for us it highlights a specific time window but that's not the importance by itself the importance is blending the two things to give us indications with prognostication behind the element of time and price okay so we see a stop run
          
          in London creates the higher low of the day a continuation in New York session and it runs to 10:00 to noon on the day and creates the opposite end of the daily range if we created a low in London we expected high the form between 10:00 in the morning and noon the algo does this every single day it's just either a buy day a consolidation day or a sell day that's all you get that's the three things you have to worry about with understanding the interbank algo okay there are folks that you're going
          
          to listen to because I've recently went to a paid membership they're going to say that there is no such thing as a interbank algo and some may factiously make snide remarks about how it doesn't exist or it's contrived but I can tell you just sit back and watch just see the level Precision that comes by way of what I'm teaching you and it comes with the understanding of what the interbank algo actually is it's the delivery of price and it's completely systematic and it's uniform every single day it does
          
          the same type of thing it's small little deviations here and there but nonetheless it's the same thing happening all the time Okay so we've covered how to calibrate New York time because it's essential we need to know what's going on in New York because I sets the day I guess that's when the algo comes online at midnight in New York the London session between uh 2:00 in the morning and 5:00 a.m. it closes at 5:00 a.m. U that window of time usually sets the higher low of the day if you're bullish on the market it's
          
          going to set the low of the day if it's bearish on the market it's going to set the high of the day okay so London makes the higher low of the day relative to the trend Direction now we're going to teach Trend direction we're going to teach daily bias and a greater degree that you've ever seen me ever do in this mentorship it just can't happen in one video and it can't happen the first month it's a long drawn out process a lot of elements is going to come together and you'll get all kinds of framework and I know some of you are
          
          absolutely EC static okay that you're learning what you're learning and you can't wait to get to the next thing you are being too too impatient and you have to wait to get to the next stage of our uh teachings don't try to expect it all to come in one time it's going to take a little bit of time it's a 12- month process so you're going to get through this one step at a time you're going to learn every single time we do a video every single time we do a live session every day so far since we started the
          
          mentorship you've seen value it's at least that's my hope we've been able to call the Market Direction in intraday and it's using these elements that I'm teaching here this is just the surface Foundation that you have to have going into this okay so that way when I'm talking about London Killzone I just showed you how to map it out on Forex LTD if I'm talking about New York Killzone this is exactly what I'm talking about how to map it out okay watch the video take notes take notes take notes okay when we
          
          see the market trade into the 3:00 window okay or or hour that's usually the close of the day now the average uh volume for the entire day is I'm sorry I shouldn't say average the majority of the volume I should say is between the London and overlapping the uh New York that's the largest volume New York is the easiest trading setup it's easy to trade those setups in New York because you got the benefit of knowing what London did um I used to do trades like this here Trading the reversal at London
          
          close um it's just not enough for me to be worried about anymore but I want you to look at what we see here the open is here at midnight it trades down makes the low of the day rallies up breaks a short-term high that and that gives us credibility to expect an advancement up on the upside I gave you indications today in Twitter for September 5th that the Euro was going to go lower into a specific level and I'll leave that for you to study with all the information I've shared on the Forum and on Twitter
          
          but when we break this short-term High we know that we can come back to a bullish order block and you just got to find out what that order block is and it has to happen inside of a a London open Kill Zone and you'll get a high quality order block that way and in New York when it comes back down it hits that level in range expansion it happens again all the way up into 10:00 to noon New York time everything I say in time is specifically related to New York time don't get confused about your local time
          
          don't get confused about some other platform that you're trading through or your own broker's platform time it's going to mess you up you just need to take the information we're looking at on this medium Forex ltd's demo account and then see what that looks like on your own charts at the same time but the trade ideas and the framework for the trades are always going to be referencing what we see here on Forex ltd's demo account okay um anyway between uh 10:00 in the morning and noon New York time it will create the high of
          
          the day generally if it's not been a consolidation day or a reversal uh profile in New York which we'll talk about that and we'll teach that in great detail so please if you hear me say things don't go in asking the uh the have the complete expose on the topic I'll touch on a little bit if there's time uh but I will promise you continuously that you're going to learn every thing I know over the 12 months that we're here I got detailed notes there's so many things you you you can't learn in just one or two sessions it
          
          won't satisfy so if I try to spend time answering your questions about specific Concepts right now and you're especially if you're new uh you're not going to be satisfied in the answer because there's other things that have to go along with that to make sense and believe me it doesn't feel like I'm doing you a service right now it feels like I'm doing you a disservice by saying that but in fact I'm doing you the greatest service in the world because I'm showing you in small pieces that you can digest
          
          it doesn't matter what you think you're going to be able to learn in terms of speed this does not happen overnight and I'm giving you a framework to gradually grow into this and you will be amazing in your price action skills and your prognostication at the end of 12 months trust me in that trust me okay submit to a time and you'll get exactly what you're paying for and more but the market will come off off the high that's created between 10:00 and 12:00 in the afternoon when it does that it'll
          
          retrace a little bit and then go into the close so you can see the daily range is it opens here trades down makes a low of the day expands on the upside makes a high day and closes off the low And Trades back here so it's a consolidation day we've closed at 3:00 essentially right where we opened at at midnight in New York so midnight New York time to 300 p.m. New York time this is has been a consolidation day it opened and closed at the same place I'm going to give you a horizont line right here it opened here and
          
          closed essentially right at the same spot here's the actual close here but it's just a little bit away from that so we didn't really go anywhere but it's still operated with the same parameters I teach in my tutorials because it's on the interbank algo the the market is delivering price based on systematic time-based routines that this thing does all the time and once you understand how it operates it's like cracking the code on a safe you just you're in there and it can't stop you okay so um we're going to teach a lot about
          
          um specifics and Concepts that are in great detail you're going to have eight more teachings this month okay and I want you to know what they are right now uh this one was just setting up and and uh that way you can observe price when I'm talking about things in Twitter uh if I'm talking about specific times of the day uh in my Forum in uh installments you know what I'm talking about when I say London setup or I'm sorry London Killzone or New York Killzone um you know where to look at it on your
          
          chart and it's also teaching you to to log your charts at the end of the day so that way when we look at charts we should have them doctored up like this okay where's the beginning of the day where's the end of the day I just showed you 12:00 a.m. New York 3:00 p.m. New York That's How It Ends that's called true day two it's t r u e d a y true day it's two words okay and this is the format for a true interbank interbank rather Market day don't think about Wellington don't don't incorporate Asia
          
          forget all that okay the majority of the money that you need to worry about is between these two windows of time and Trust when I tell you we're going to amplify on that over the next 12 months and it's going to knock your socks off but the elements that we're going to be teaching uh specifically in the remainder of September again you got two more videos this week and then you'll have six more after that before the end of the month okay so the next video we're talking about is elements to a trade setup and how market makers
          
          condition market pricing okay so we're going to talk about uh those two things and and in separate videos and that's going to be delivered to you this coming Saturday and the next two are what you should be focusing on right now and the uh second one of next week will be equilibrium versus discount and then the next two are going to be equilibrium versus premium and fair valuation and the next two are going to be liquidity runs high resistance and low resistance and impulse swings and Market protraction okay sounds high and
          
          lofty but uh we're going to get into some really technical things in a conceptual way so that way we'll be able to flesh out those ideas with specifics and price action that repeat over and over and over again so you have eight more really influential ideas that's going to be taught to you uh the month of September and then we're going to go into October with a greater understanding about Market manage I'm sorry money management and compounding small accounts so it's going to give you uh a theme of that month but we're also going
          
          to be incorporating specific time elements with price to help you build these ideas but the theme of next month is going to be working with money management and small account growth so building up small accounts but we're going to have a lot of technical things taught um you be amplifying order blocks and liquidity voids and uh Fair valuation equilibrium all those things every single month I'm going to give give you elements to each one of those components and give you scenarios and I'm going to give you two retail traps
          
          that happen every single Market day it happens every single day once you understand what they are there's 24 of them there's two on kach each month so there's 24 retail Trader traps that market makers use okay you're going to get two of them every single month they will be laced inside the teachings okay and when it's um being focused on you'll know in the recording it'll be highlighted in the screen that you this is the retail trap and I'll explain in you a great deal what what they are um but for now we're going to close this
