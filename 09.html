          [Music] [Music] oh [Music] okay folks we're going to be looking at impulse price swings and Market protraction very similar ideas but uniquely different um I'm going to first talk about impulse price swings a impulse price swing would be something like this okay so we have an Impulse price swing down then we have another impulse price swing higher then we have another impulse price swing lower and another impulse swing higher followed by impulse swing lower and a higher swing of impulse movement higher then we
          
          have another impulse swing lower followed by another impulse swing higher followed by an Impulse swing lower another impulse swing higher and ultimately another impulse swing lower so we have price swings moving from high down to a low to another high down to another low to a high to a low to another high making another low up to a high down to a low up to a high down to a low when you look at Price action you need to be thinking in terms of impulse price swings because inside the impulse price swings it's going to give you a
          
          lot of detail now there are smaller more specific impulse price swings that have a lot more influence over the marketplace in the form of a manipulative move or Market making manipulation so let's take all this off and focus primarily on protraction now if we look at the market with the similar ideas we just Illustrated with every impulsive price swing and then we add to it time of day by coding down control and tapping y on your keyboard you'll add the vertical dations for zero GMT so zero GMT
          
          vertical line to another day divider basically when we see this okay then we can look at time sensitive impulse price swings which is Market protraction Market protraction is time sensitive it's an Impulse price swing that is highly sensitive to a time of day there are three primary protraction Market moves every 2 24 hours the first one is rate at zero GMT you'll see one little movement away or lower in other words up or down right at that at delineation in time uh you see one here it trades down
          
          away from it then moves higher we see this one here it trades down then moves higher you see this one here trades higher this one here it trades higher and that's all we're going to look at for for that Asian session I don't believe Asia is that influential initially um the other Market protraction are state is in is in London now we can take the control y feature off and just focus on the vertical lines here delineating midnight New York initially right after midnight New York on this day we have a market move
          
          higher this Market move here is a protraction market phase where the market trades up initially at a specific time of day so there's an Impulse price swing here but its design is to fake out the individuals that chase that initial move after midnight the second impulsive price swing starts in New York we delineate at 7 o'clock in the morning and we anticipate if the market has moved lower in London we're going to be looking for a retracement higher that impulsive price move higher is Market protraction it's designed and intended
          
          for manipulation only it's to get traders to think that the the Market's making a low in this case it rallies up and then trades down ultimately here again here's New York time and New York session opening Market goes into another proactionary Market state right after the 7 o'cl hour going into New York open small little retracement then Market trades lower again 7:00 in the morning the market goes into a small impulse price swing higher this is Market protraction its intent is for for manipulation it's
          
          counter Direction in other words if this move occurs at this time of day if it goes higher we think the opposite direction if it goes lower we think the opposite direction so if it initially moves higher and the Market's been going lower we see that as manipulation or Market protraction Market's going to seek to draw in participants on the wrong side of the marketplace or reach for liquidity it has to happen after 7 o'clock in the morning has to happen after 7 o'clock in the morning and it has to happen after
          
          7:00 in the morning the other one is in the London session obviously and it's after for GMT on the forx LTD demo account if we see a movement higher and we're bearish we see that as Market protraction or a Judah swing it's a false rally to sell into same thing occurs in after New York's 7 o'clock in the morning time we anticipate a ground up off the London high so when we see that we expect the market to go into a protraction state where it rallies up to reach for liquidity and then expand down this day here Market drops
          
          initially right from the midnight candle drops lower then rallies up so this is Market protraction it seeks liquidity below the market over here clearing out lows and then rallies rate it New York markets one more time little rally in here and then sells off the next day London we see initial rally after midnight candle and then it trades lower right after 7 o'clock in the morning New York we get one more protraction are state in the marketplace where the market rallies again small minor little
          
          impulse price swing but it's design is to manipulate the sentiment and or the thoughts of Traders wanting to be participants this would look like a low and this run up here would entice buyers in the New York session and then they reverse it having these things in mind we can look at the market in the context of what we shared so far for this month we see a market move down from Market impulse price swing so we can measure that swing [Music] down from the high we can use this one this High down to this low and it
          
          retraces back up above equilibrium so we go into a premium Market at the 62% retracement level we can sell there with a move expecting to see a run below this low Market goes into the protraction are phase after an Impulse price swing we can be a seller reaching for liquidity below the lows and looking over here in previous days we can find an old low back here as well and Market trades down into that level Market makes another impulsive price swing here in this context the market rallies up with another U Move
          
          higher in the next London session it's in Judah swing lower or Market protraction are phase faking Traders out thinking is going to drop a initially and it rallies up and it rallies up into the New York session right into a premium market so we're blending impulse price swings and then time of day ret trade rate back into equilibrium for market protraction right in here and then it expands going lower taking out stops below the lows over here and aiming for the stops below these equal lows which they accumulate here
          
          [Music] another impulse price swing here down to the low right here impulse swing up right at the New York midnight candle Jud to swing higher fake move higher it trades down going into New York we see another protraction Market phase where it trades up right into an area where it sold off before lower expansion reaching down into the 3255 level why would it reach down there and why is it quickly moving so fast to go down to that level is because you can see the old low over here the difference in be in
          
          determining impulse price swings and in Market protraction is the fact that there is a time element applied to the small impulse swing after midnight New York time after 7:00 a.m. New York time and 8:00 p.m. New York time there's usually a protraction market phase that enters the marketplace and it's a small little impulse price swing that's counter the major direction that you're going to see after that specific time of day so for session trading and for session drills you can use this concept to help give you
          
          context in your practicing and also build your anticipatory price skills
